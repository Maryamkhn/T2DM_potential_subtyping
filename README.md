This codes related to the paper entiteled "Unraveling the Molecular Heterogeneity in type 2 Diabetes: A Potential Subtype Discovery Study Followed by Metabolic Modeling". In this paper, we have explored the muscle gene expression pattern in healthy and newly-diagnosed T2DM individuals using supervised and unsupervised classification along with the discovery of potential subtypes of type 2 diabetes.  A machine-learning technique applied to identify a pattern of gene expression that could potentially discriminates between normoglycemic and diabetic groups. In addition, three distinct potential subtypes with different dysregulated genes and metabolic pathways identified in diabetic patients.
